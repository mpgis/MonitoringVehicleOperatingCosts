The implemented application allows registered users to enter data about refueling and events using forms. Events include all service work related to vehicles, from repairs to periodic filter and oil changes. Based on the collected data, the user is able to display statistics about his vehicle or all owned vehicles, where there is a summary of the number of refueling and events, total operating costs, costs per a specified number of kilometers and in the last period of time. The application also includes global statistics showing the average fuel prices at selected stations based on the price values entered by application users and less detailed data on the operation of each vehicle model in the database.
